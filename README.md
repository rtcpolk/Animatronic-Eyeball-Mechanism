# Animatronic Eyeball Mechanism
An animatronic eyeball mechanism that rotates a sphereical eyeball 360Â° (or more) around any axis. Developed using ROS2 with microROS for the ESP32.

## About the Project
This eyeball mechanism is being developed by `Team Blink` at Vanderbilt University for our mechanical engineering senior captstone project. This project is sponsored by [Animax Designs](https://www.animaxdesigns.com/), a global animatronic company based in Nashville, TN. The mechanism is able to rotate a spherical eyeball around any axis and has two operational modes: `Path Following` and `Facial Tracking` (hopefully).

While the code in this repository is specialized for this mechanism, hopefully it can serve as a guide for those looking to integrate `ROS2` and `microROS` into their own robotics projects.

## Project Mechatronics
This project utilizes the following:
```
ESP32 Dev Modules
MPU6050 6-Axis IMU
DC Motors w/ Encoders
Ubuntu 22.04 (run on a VM)
ROS2 Humble
MicroRos
```

## Installation
This section is a guide on how I installed all of the necessary dependencies and setup the project workspaces. This is my first time working with something of this nature, and I had to piece together a few different tutorials online as I couldn't find one that worked out of the gate. Links to those tutorials are at the end of this section. 

If you are unfamiliar with `ROS2` or `microROS`, check out the official [ROS2 Concepts Documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts.html) or [microROS Concepts Documentation](https://micro.ros.org/docs/concepts/client_library/introduction/).

### Installing VMWare, Ubuntu, and ROS2
The class I am taking had us install `ROS2` on Ubuntu 22.04. `ROS2` and `microROS` seem to have better support for Ubuntu, but should work with Windows and macOS. If you don't use Ubuntu, the following steps should still apply but the commands will be different.

`VMWare` is now free and can be used to create virtal machines that allow you to run a different OS than what is native to your computer. To install `VMWare` for Windows use this [download](https://vanderbilt365-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/hao_yang_vanderbilt_edu/EV_91KZyB4xBiFNZSW5ffjQBcetFDbwrvGudhkRSaf6fvw?e=VUdvoN) and follow this [tutorial](https://shaileshjha.com/how-to-install-vmware-workstation-12-pro-on-windows-10/).

Once `VMWare` is installed, download [Ubuntu 22.04.5 Desktop Image](https://vanderbilt365-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/hao_yang_vanderbilt_edu/ESSq4SrNMhBLvuMlTSyhBNoBTE-sshxs2tIUgoP59lGs3Q?e=NeBvae), and follow this [turtorial](https://medium.com/@florenceify74/how-to-download-install-and-run-ubuntu-in-vmware-workstation-ce5f2d4d0438) to set up your VM.

`ROS2` has excellent documentation and tutorials. Follow this [tutorial](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html) to download `ROS2` onto your Ubuntu VM. Follow this [tutorial](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html) to create a workspace in the `ros2_ws` directory.

### Installing MicroROS
To install `microROS` follow the official [tutorial](https://micro.ros.org/docs/tutorials/core/first_application_rtos/freertos/) on creating your first microROS application for FreeRTOS. Follow the steps to install the `microROS` build system into the `microros_ws` directory. This will create a workspace with ready to use shells that enable you to build and flash applications to the ESP32. 

I ran into two problems when following the tutorials. If you do not have permission to access the serial ports see this [fix](). If you have issues with an unstable USB serial connection see this [fix](). After following these fixes to get permission and remove brltty I was able to complete the remainder of the tutorial successfully.

The tutorial takes you through the 4 step build process to flash an example app onto the ESP32. Since this project uses an ESP32 with FreeRTOS the `# Create` step command is:
```
ros2 run micro_ros_setup create_firmware_ws.sh freertos esp32
```
Follow the rest of the tutorial to flash the example app, setup the agent on the host computer, and test that the system is working. Assuming all went well, (and you avoided the painstaking time spent ~~debugging~~ learning the quirks of Ubuntu and how to use the command line all while questioning why you continually put yourself into this situation) you should now have a successful microROS build system as part of your project.

## Usage
### Structure
This project is structured with the root directory `Animatronic-Eyeball-Mechanism` containing two workspaces - `microros_Ws` and `ros2_ws`. I did this because the `microROS` applications that run on the microcontroller have a different build sequence than the traditional `ros2` packages that run on the host computer. There is likley a way to combine these into a single workspace but I left them separate for simplicity sake. All of the applications that will be flashed onto the ESP32 go into the `microros_ws/...` directory, and all of the normal `ROS2` nodes / packages go into the 

### 

There are 4 steps to the `microROS` build system:
```
Create: Download the required code for your specific microcontroller
Configure: Select which app to compile and eventually flash onto your microcontroller
Build: Build the app and generate project binaries
Flash: Upload the binaries onto your microcontroller
```
The documentation goes more in depth on these steps, and a short explination on how to use them for this prject can be found below in Usage. The tutorial takes you through these four steps and eventually flashes an example program onto your microcontroller.
First create a firmware workspace that contains the necessary code and tools for the ESP32:
```
ros2 run micro_ros_setup create_firmware_ws.sh freertos esp32
```
If you are using a different microcontroller or RTOS then the above comand will change. Next, configure the workspace to upload the example app via Serial:
```
ros2 run micro_ros_setup configure_firmware.sh ping_pong --transport serial
```
Once the configuring step is complete, build the firmware:
```
ros2 run micro_ros_setup build_firmware.sh
```
Finally, plug in your ESP32 to your host coputer via serial and flash:
```
ros2 run micro_ros_setup flash_firmware.sh
```
Your app should now be uploaded to the ESP32. Next, the agent needs to be created on the host computer. This agent is the bridge that allows `microROS` and `ROS2` to interact.
