# Animatronic Eyeball Mechanism
An animatronic eyeball mechanism that rotates a sphereical eyeball 360Â° (or more) around any axis. Developed using ROS2 with microROS for the ESP32.

## About
This eyeball mechanism is being developed by `Team Blink` at Vanderbilt University for our mechanical engineering senior captstone project. This project is sponsored by [Animax Designs](https://www.animaxdesigns.com/), a global animatronic company based in Nashville, TN. The mechanism is able to rotate a spherical eyeball around any axis, allowing any point on the sphere to be front facing. It has two operational modes: `path following` and `facial tracking` (hopefully).

While the code in this repository is specialized for this mechanism, hopefully it can serve as a guide for those looking to integrate `ROS2` and `microROS` into their own robotics projects.

## Project Hardware and Software
This project utilizes the following:
```
ESP32 Dev Modules
Ubuntu 22.04 (run on a VM)
ROS2 Humble
MicroRos
```

## Installation
This section is a guide on how I installed all of the necessary dependencies and setup the project workspaces. I pieced together a few different tutorials online as I couldn't find one that worked out of the gate. Links to those tutorials are at the end of this section. 

### Installing Ubuntu on a Virutal Machine
### Installing ROS2 Humble
### Installing MicroROS
To install `microROS follow the official [tutorial]() on the
