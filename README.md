## About
This eyeball mechanism is being developed by `Team Blink` at Vanderbilt University for our mechanical engineering senior captstone project. This project is sponsored by [Animax Designs](https://www.animaxdesigns.com/), a global animatronic company based in Nashville, TN. The mechanism is able to rotate a spherical eyeball around any axis, allowing any point on the sphere to be front facing. It has two operational modes: `path following` and `facial tracking` (hopefully).

While this repository is rather specialized, hopefully it can serve as a guide for those looking to integrate `ROS2` and `microROS` into their robotics projects.

## Hardware and Software Requirements
This project utilizes the following:
```
Ubuntu 22.04
ROS2 Humble
MicroRos
ESP32 Dev Modules
```
